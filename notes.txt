Why split up Biopython?
=======================

* Easier maintenance, module authors have their package live in their own repo and are responsible for that
* Lower barrier for contribution
* Lightweight install for users, only install what's needed without worrying about things like C-compilation, etc.


Issues to consider
==================

* Which modules go to the base module?
* How would packaging work?
* How would OS-specific packaging system work? (e.g. installing via apt or pacman)
